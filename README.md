## safebrowsing-zig

High-performance, Zig implementation of Google Safe Browsing v5 lookups (https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/)

* protobuf deserialization code generated using https://github.com/Arwalk/zig-protobuf
* Host-Suffix Path-Prefix Expressions generation as defined [here](https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/reference/URLs.and.Hashing#host-suffix-path-prefix-expressions)
* Local threat database decoding from protobuf using Golomb-Rice compression as defined [here](https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/reference/Local.Database)
* Real-Time mode: expressions checked against the Global Cache list
* Check SHA-256 prefixes against the local database
* Designed to scan millions of URLs (sub-second on modern hardware)
* Outputs a list of "unsure" 4-byte prefixes to verify via Google's hash search endpoint

### How it works

1. **Expression URLs**

* For each input URL, it computes the v5 host-suffix / path-prefix set.
* eTLD+1 are respected using [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/)
* Each expression URL is canonicalized and hashed (SHA-256) to generate 4-byte (prefix) keys.

2. **Global Cache (Real-Time)**

* Before touching the local DB, it checks the global cache list for real-time verdicts that can short-circuit lookups.

3. **Local Database**

* It loads and decodes the v5 threat list database from Google's update API.
* The protobuf payload is decoded and Golombâ€“Rice compressed chunks are expanded into a compact prefix set.

4. **Unsure prefixes**

* If a prefix is present but a full hash verdict is required, it emits it in the "unsure" output list for a follow-up hash search request to Google.
* This minimizes online calls while preserving detection.

## TODO

- [ ] Emit base64 prefix of unsure URLs to be checked against the search endpoint (https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/reference/rest/v5/hashes/search)
- [ ] CLI flags to pass Hash lists database binary file
